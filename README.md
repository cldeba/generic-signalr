# generic-signalr
Provides client-side functionality to execute generic client-to-server and server-to-client invocations using SignalR. Use this package to improve type-safety and code quality when making use of SignalR features. This package makes the unsafe use of  HubConnection's On and SendMessage methods obsolete.
